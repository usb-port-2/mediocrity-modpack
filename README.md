1. Download Codename Engine! Click the links below corresponding to your OS:
- [Windows](https://nightly.link/FNF-CNE-Devs/CodenameEngine/workflows/windows/main/Codename%20Engine.zip)
- [MacOS](https://nightly.link/FNF-CNE-Devs/CodenameEngine/workflows/macos/main/Codename%20Engine.zip)
- [Linux](https://nightly.link/FNF-CNE-Devs/CodenameEngine/workflows/linux/main/Codename%20Engine.zip)
2. Extract the Codename Engine .zip you just downloaded!
3. Download the MEDIOCRITY. modpack here.
4. Double click the MEDIOCRITY. .zip to open it, and then right-click on the folder labelled "Mediocrity", and press "Copy".
5. Navigate your way to the extracted Codename Engine folder, and find the folder called "mods" inside it.
6. Open the "mods" folder, and you should be greeted with just a "readme.txt" file. Paste the folder here!
7. Open Codename Engine (it's the .exe file)! (This is apparently a genuine issue people have T~T)
8. It *should* open MEDIOCRITY. straight away, but if you're greeted with the normal FNF menu, press the "Tab" key and scroll down to select "Mediocrity".
